iterate through the CSV data files, returning a hashref for each postcode.

This data can then be inserted as a row into a data store.

Example database MySQL table definition:

    CREATE TABLE `gb_postcodes` (
      `outcode` char(4) NOT NULL,
      `incode` char(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
      `latitude` decimal(7,5) DEFAULT NULL,
      `longitude` decimal(7,5) DEFAULT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (`outcode`,`incode`)
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1
